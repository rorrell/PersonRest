# PersonRest
RESTful web service with NoSQL database, at one time deployed to AWS (didn't leave up indefinitely due to being a free tier user)

NOTE: I originally deployed this to my BitBucket account: https://bitbucket.org/rorrell/personrest

This uses JavaEE and has classes that allow connections and interactions with both MongoDB and DynamoDB.  I had successfully deployed it to Elastic Beanstalk on AWS.  The RESTful web services serve up purse JSON.
